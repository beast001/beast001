I am a software Engineer and Data Analyst with a passion for Artificial Intelligence, Data, and Building Communities.
I have a strong analytical mindset and can identify patterns and trends in data while also being able to communicate my findings to non-technical stakeholders.I am comfortable working in a fast-paced environment and can meet tight deadlines.
I have worked in various industries, including the judiciary, e-commerce, and advertisement companies, and have experience with A/B testing, customer segmentation, and forecasting. I am a team player, and comfortable working with cross-functional teams to deliver projects on time and to the highest quality standards.
